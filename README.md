# Bloch Sphere Visualization #

This is a visualization of a Quantum bit (Qubit) and several Quantum gates using a Bloch Sphere. Quantum gates are transformations to a qubit. These transformations are visualized through rotations of a globe. A globe is used for easy understanding of 'north' (0) and 'south' (1) pole of the sphere. 

This visualization includes an easy to use visual interface. 

Gates available are: Hadamard (H), Pauli X, Y, and Z, Phase Shift (S), Pi/8, and Square Root Not.

### Usage instructions: ###

1) Install Python as per the instructions on the VPython Site (installing the version he suggests) â€“ ie. 2.7.6 from the Python site

2) Install VPython on Windows, I used VPython-Win-64-Py2.7-6.10
At this point you should be able to open the example projects (ie. Bounce.py, located in C:Python27Libsite-packagesvisualexamples)

But more importantly, you will NOT be able to run Bloch_Sphere.py, you need more for that.

3) Install numPy (A math/science package for Python, for the windows copy I got it here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy (Version 2.7 again)

That *should* get it working. Email me if you run into troubles.
